"KASYA SAMPU" Cubao Free is a Display Typeface also dedicated to the Filipino Sign makers, Jeepney drivers, and the daily commuters of Metro Manila and anywhere in the Philippines. Like the previously published typeface 'Quiapo Free', Cubao Free was inspired by the signboards hanged on Jeepneys, SUVs, Buses and other transport vehicles within and outside the Metro.

Cubao Free has three variants or widths: Narrow, Regular and Wide. It is designed to fill words or route/destination name in a rectangular space, mostly paired with bright neon colors in black background for readability.

Crafted by Aaron Amar, a proud Filipino.
